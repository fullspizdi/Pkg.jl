# Pkg.jl

Pkg.jl is a Julia package designed to provide essential mathematical operations and transformations, enhancing Julia's capabilities for numerical computations.

## Installation

To install Pkg.jl, open your Julia REPL, enter the Pkg mode by pressing `]`, and run the following command:

```julia
add Pkg
```

Alternatively, you can use the following Julia command:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Pkg")
```

## Usage

### Basic Examples

Here are some basic examples of how to use the functions provided by Pkg.jl:

```julia
using Pkg

# Example usage of some_function
result1 = some_function(10)  # Expected output: 20

# Example usage of another_function
result2 = another_function(5)  # Expected output: 15
```

### Explanation of Key Functions

- `some_function(x)`: Multiplies the input `x` by 2. Useful for doubling values.
- `another_function(y)`: Adds 10 to the input `y`. Useful for incrementing values by a fixed amount.

## Advanced Usage

For more complex scenarios, you can combine multiple functions:

```julia
using Pkg

# Using combined_function to process multiple inputs
final_result = combined_function(3, 4, 5)  # Processes inputs through different functions and sums the results
```

## Notes
