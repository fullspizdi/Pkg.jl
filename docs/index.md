# Welcome to Pkg.jl Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for Pkg.jl, a Julia package designed to enhance numerical computations by providing essential mathematical operations and transformations. This documentation aims to provide you with all the information you need to effectively utilize Pkg.jl in your projects.

## Installation

To install Pkg.jl, you can use the Julia package manager. Here are the steps:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Pkg")
```

## Usage

Pkg.jl offers a variety of functions that are straightforward to use. Below are some examples and explanations of the key functions.

### Basic Examples

```julia
using Pkg

# Example usage of some_function
result1 = some_function(10)  # Expected output: 20

# Example usage of another_function
result2 = another_function(5)  # Expected output: 15
```

### Key Functions

- `some_function(x)`: Multiplies the input `x` by 2. This function is useful for quickly doubling values.
- `another_function(y)`: Adds 10 to the input `y`. It is useful for incrementing values by a fixed amount.

## Advanced Usage

For more complex scenarios, Pkg.jl allows the combination of multiple functions to achieve more sophisticated operations:

```julia
using Pkg

# Using combined_function to process multiple inputs
final_result = combined_function(3, 4, 5)  # Processes inputs through different functions and sums the results
```

## Modules and Functions

### Module: Pkg

- **Functions:**
  - `some_function(x)`: Doubles the input value.
  - `another_function(y)`: Adds 10 to the input value.

### Module: Functions

- **Functions:**
  - `additional_function(z)`: Squares the input value `z`.
  - `combined_function(x, y, z)`: Combines the results of `some_function`, `another_function`, and `additional_function`.
